Want to know a little bit about how VSXu works internally? Or do you want to contribute? VSXu is licensed under the GNU GPL license.

By writing "modules" - building blocks - for VSXu we can together make it better. It's dead easy, let us show you how.

Need visualizations or an easy way to author real time OpenGL in your software?
Then consider embedding vsxu_engine into your project!
