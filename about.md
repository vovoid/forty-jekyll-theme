            VSXu (VSX Ultra) is an OpenGL-based (hardware-accelerated), modular programming environment with its main purpose to visualize music and create graphic effects in real-time.</p>
            
            <p>
            Its intention is to bridge the gap between programmer and artist and enabling a creative and inspiring environment to work in for all parties involved.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            VSXu is built on a modular plug-in-based architecture so anyone can extend it and or make visualization presets ("visuals" or "states").
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The VSXu suite is <a href="http://fsf.org">free software</a> which means it's free from restrictions, free to share and copy, free to adapt / modify and use it any way you like.
